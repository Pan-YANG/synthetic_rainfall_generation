# synthetic_rainfall_generation
Source codes for the synthetic rainfall generation methods used in the paper: Gauging through the Crowd: A Crowd-Sourcing Approach to Urban Rainfall Measurement and Stormwater Modeling Implications

Use

'[results]=gen_rain_fields(rainfield_param,study_area_pos);'

to run the model. rainfield_param is a matlab structure with all the needed parameters. Read the paper for the definitions of these parameters. An example set of parameters is provided in the file 'exam_rainfield_param.mat'.
